    "In efforts to understand trends in pet adoption outcomes, the Austin Animal Center has provided data relating to the pets in their adoption center. Understanding this data and using it to model the factors that influence pet adoption could lead to recommendations that improve the performance of the center and help more pets find homes.\n",

    "This table gives a much better look at what is going on in the data. Starting from the leftmost column are the following observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. **Animal ID** - This is a unique identifier for each entry that is a letter combined with a number. This seems well-formatted.\n",
    "     \n",
    "   2. **Name** - Some entries are missing here, and there are also some entries with asterisks before the names (e.g. \\*Pebbles, \\*Johnny). It will be useful if we can find out the meaning of the asterisk in this field.  \n",
    "     \n",
    "   3. **DateTime** and **MonthYear** - These columns look like datetime objects, but they look identical for the entries we see. If we verify that the columns are identical, we may be better served removing one.\n",
    "     \n",
    "   4. **Date of Birth** - This year may also be converted into a datetime object, so that we can perform time-series analysis with this information.\n",
    "     \n",
    "   5. **Outcome Type** - There are several categories in this column, and we may be able to convert the entries into categories for easier handling.\n",
    "     \n",
    "   6. **Outcome Subtype** - This has many missing entries, and we only see categories for Euthanasia and Transfer corresponding outcome types. Depending on the number of subtypes for these types, it may be more efficient to integrate them into the outcome type category.\n",
    "     \n",
    "   7. **Animal Type** - In addition to cats and dogs, there is an 'Other' category here in the third entry, corresponding to a 'Raccoon Mix' breed of animal. With the small amount of types of animals, this column is likely to perform better as categorical values.\n",
    "     \n",
    "   8. **Age upon Outcome** - If we are able to convert this into a uniform value (e.g. age in months) we can work with these values as numbers which will make analyzing this data easier. It should also be noted that if we work with the Outcome DateTime and Date of Birth columns as datetime objects, columns like this can be generated by arithmetic operations.\n",
    "     \n",
    "   9. **Breed** and **Color** - These columns look well-formatted, but more investigation is needed in order to determine whether they will perform better as categorical values, or what additional ways they can be transformed in order to yield more information.\n",
