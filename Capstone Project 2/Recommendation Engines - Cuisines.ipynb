    "In this section, I will use a TF-IDF format of the recipe data that I have been working with [here](https://github.com/emenriquez/Springboard-Coursework/blob/master/Capstone%20Project%202/EDA%20-%20Cuisines.ipynb) to create recommendation engines for the following applications that could be used by users of the Yummly service:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple recommendation engine** - recommend the most similar recipes to a user's current recipe\n",
    "2. **Recipe discovery engine** - recommend the most similar recipes to a user's current recipe that are from different cuisines unique from the user's original recipe cuisine.  \n",
    "    Example: (User's recipe is Italian) \"Here are 3 similar recipes from French, Irish, and Spanish cuisines.\"  \n",
    "3. **Ingredient list recommendation engine** - take the ingredients that a user has, and recommend recipes that can be made, along with suggestions for which additional ingredients they may need.\n",
    "4. **Ingredient pairing recommendation engine** - take ingredients for a user's recipe and recommend ingredients that are likely to pair well based on how often they are used together in the dataset."
